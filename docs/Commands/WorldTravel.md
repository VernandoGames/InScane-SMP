# Traveling through the worlds

With this SMP, we want to keep things simple for new players. Because of this, we have systems for teleporting to various points of the world, as well as *other worlds*.

## How do I set a home?
To set your current location as a teleport point, you can [set it as your home](#set-home). After you have set a given location as your home, you can [teleport to your home by name.](#homes)

## Commands

### Nether
Running this command will immediately teleport you to the nether, as if you had just gone through a portal.  
**Usage**: ``/nether``

### End
