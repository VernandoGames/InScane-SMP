After securing land, you can whitelist certain people to be able to have full priveleges on this land. Note: you can not change specific permissions, but rather choose whether a user has full permission or no permission. All or nothing You may not claim public domain or land you are not actively building onto. Admins can take away your land at any point if you fail to comply with this. How do you claim land? \u00b6 In order to claim a plot of land, you must obtain a golden shovel. Once you have this, right-click one corner of your land (or whatever key you use to place blocks) and do the same on the corner diagonal to it. Before claiming a plot of land, you must have enough blocks available for ownership. To check how many blocks you currently have available, run the command /claimslist . The blocks are a direct measure of the area you can claim. So, if you want to claim a 5x4 block plot of land, you must have 20 blocks available. Commands \u00b6 Claim \u00b6 Claiming a plot of land allows you to protect this land and whitelist certain people to have access to it. Note: this does not prevent people from entering this land, just interacting with storage and breaking/placing objects Usage : /claim Aliases : unknown Unclaim \u00b6 Unclaiming land removes your ownership from this plot of land. Usage : /unclaim Aliases : unknown Trust \u00b6 Setting a user as trusted allows them to bypass the limitations applied to normal users on your land. Meaning, they can access all of your storage as well as place/destroy blocks. Usage : /trust <user> Untrust \u00b6 Running this command removes a user's trusted* permissions, meaning they can no longer access any of your storage or place/destroy blocks on your land.
