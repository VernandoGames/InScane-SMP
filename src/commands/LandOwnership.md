# Land Ownership

In this server, we have a system for securing plots of land. After securing land, you can whitelist certain people to be able to have full priveleges on this land.  
*Note: you can not change specific permissions, but rather choose whether a user has full permission or no permission. All or nothing.*

## How do you claim land?
In order to claim a plot of land, you must obtain a golden shovel. Once you have this, right-click one corner of the land you are wanting to claim (or whatever key you use to place blocks) and do the same on the corner diagonal to it.  
Before claiming a plot of land, you must have enough blocks available for ownership. To check how many blocks you currently have available, run the command ``/claimslist``. The blocks are a direct measure of the *area* you can claim. So, if you want to claim a 5x4 block plot of land, you must have 20 blocks available.
