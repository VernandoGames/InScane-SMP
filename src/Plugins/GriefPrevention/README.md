# Grief Prevention Plugin
[Source](https://github.com/TechFortress/GriefPrevention)

Grief Prevention is a Minecraft server plugin which stops grief before it starts automatically without any effort from administrators, and with very little (self service) effort from players. Solve all your grief problems with a single download, no database, and no configuration step (the default configuration is sane and will likely be all you need, but of course everything is configurable and fine-tuneable to your liking).
